# Sprint-4-final-project
This is my final project for Sprint 4 in the TripleTen DS Program
I have looked at this data as though I was hired by a dealership to help with training and increase sales based on not only local but national averages. I did this by analyzing the data in the data frame from multiple different angles! I looked at sales of of Gas vs Diesel, Automatic vs Manual transmission, also things like Age of vehicle and if the odometer reading would effect the cost of the vehicles. In the interactive app I created a sliding bar that would adjust the data to help managers / sales individuals to help make informed decisions about the tools that they can use to give them extra keys to help in the barganing process to allow them to help boost the bottom line of the dealership!
